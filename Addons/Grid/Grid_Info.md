# Description

I would recommend for your grid setup to place it where you want it while controlling your healer. 

Some people like their window to be on the left or right of the character you are driving.

I currently have mine horizontal right below my tank and I seem to enjoy it more, but this is completely up to your preference.

Once you have made your changes, practice clicking on the names to see if it feels comfortable moving your mouse to heal/cleanse etc.


## Location

Once you have positioned your grid where you prefer, you copy that config to all of your accounts. 

**Note:** I recommend deleting the grid config files from the locations you are copying into. I have had issues when I just copy over the file and the changes don't take. 

For example:
- Copy Grid.lua from account 1 folder
- Delete Grid.lua from account 2 folder
- Paste Grid.lua into account 2 folder

`<Location_to_your_Wow_Folder>\WTF\Account\<account_Name>\SavedVariables`
