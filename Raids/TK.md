## Alar

**Phase 1**
- If add spawns pick it up with tank and position yourself to remain on platform when knocked back.

**Phase 2** 
- spread out so only 1 person gets fire patch
- When alar Flies up, have everyone follow tank and keep running until alar spawns

- Keep running a bit further and then spread team back out again. This will avoid the meteor damage.
- After team is spread tank add away from team so only tank gets knocked back.
- Keep avoiding Fire patches

## Solarian
- Solarian Alarm addon helps see who has bomb
- Can either spread whole group or stack and run the person out who has bomb then run them back in
- Never stop healing

- When add phase, have whole team follow and stack up behind beam. 
- Re-drop your totems and consecrate
- Start healing and aoe at same time

- Stun the priest healers, and cleave off of priest 


## Void Reaver
- Set a button to chain heal the tank with ele sham
- Run in whole group EXCEPT ele sham stop group from following (i use down arrow to make them take a step back)

- I run Ele shammy from center off to left, cast chain heal, run him back toward center cast chain heal and repeat
- Rest of group stays stacked in the whole time

- If tank gets knocked back run tank back to stack

As long as you keep the heals up from your healer and the ele shammy spot healing with chain heal easy kill. Just takes forever.
