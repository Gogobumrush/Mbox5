## Hydross
- Position team before pulling
- I typically put healer up the ramp left side. Don't move too far up
- Spriest opposite healer, 
- Lock and Shammy bottom of ramp spread out

- Use tank to grab adds on the right can burn them down before pulling boss
- Grab boss, get threat start doing damage

- After you get 3 stacks, stop all dps, top off tank and then stop healing. Cross to poison side, grab all adds 
- Start Healing again, aoe adds, back to normal rotation

- Threat wipe every time you cross the line. 

- Be patient on opening your dps /healing back up until tank has threat.

Lust at beginning

## Lurker


## Tidewalker
- I position tucked in corner directly to the right of him (if you are facing him)

- You can pre-heal the people that get tombed before they hit the ground.
- If you did not kill lurker yet the water will still burn you

- Dont be afraid to aoe early for murlocs, they dont do a ton of damage. 
- Lock can seed facing any direction so dont worry if he gets tombed.

- When 20% I put my spriest out where the watery tombs are to soak any of the bubbles that come in. This will prevent healer from getting bubbled.

## Fathom-Lord

- Kill Order: Spitfire Totem > Caribidis > Tidalvess > Sharkkis > Karathress
- Spread out 
- Play from healer perspective so you can avoid the tornadoes
