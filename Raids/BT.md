- DPS sit under the pole for knock-ups 

- 2 Shadow Res pieces makes this super easy

- Mana pots at 65-70% 

- 2 People are periodically teleported and linked, run opposite directions to break it(the 200+ms makes this difficult)

## Illidari Council

- Health pool is shared between whole council (4) 

- Warlock tanks Zerevor on the left side, away from the group, to avoid Arcane Explosions. 

- Purge Zerevor's buff (it reduces magic damage taken)

- Tank other 3 council members at the bottom of the steps

- Interrupt Malande's Circle of Healing (every 20 secs or so)

- Veras Darkshadow immunes magic and stealths around

- Don't confuse Gathios' concencrate for your own

- Avoid the flamestrike/blizzard/concencrate


## Illidan Stormrage

Phase 1: 

- Avoid flames

- Periodic debuff on dps/heals. At the end, ads spawn. Burn FAST.

- If an ad hits someone, they'll get the debuff to spawn even more ads. Gets out of hand fast.

- Use mana pots at 65-70%, long fight

- Hellfire + Chain Lightning good combo for ads spawns

Phase 2: 

- Avoid flames (they won't despawn now)

- Spread out to avoid AOEing each other from fireballs

- Eye beams AoE bigger than it appears, there are 4 set paths

Phase 3:

- Mostly the same as phase 1, except now there's Agonizing Flames that AOEs

- Keep a spread for Agonizing Flames (blue fire, big dot, long duration)

- Keep Illidan facing away
