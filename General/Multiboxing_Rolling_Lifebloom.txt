Ok friends, as promised I finally sat down and typed out my secondary method for druid healing (aka
autopilot method, aka turbo mode). I’m doing this now cuz mainly I enjoy nerding out on it, but also to
show one example of how you can do some really really cool stuff with HKN if you start diving deep into
it and get a little creative. But first:
My basic healing setup is Numpad1-5 macroed to /cast [target=Name] Lifebloom, Numpad 6-0 macroed
to /cast [target=Name] Regrowth. I also have Tank-specific Lifebloom bound to 5 for easier spamming
when there's no raid damage. Then for more tank heals I have 0 bound to Rejuvenation and 9 to
Swiftmend. Also bound to Numpad6-0 are PW: Shield from the spriest and Chain Heal from the ele
shaman. So Numpad1-5 = normal heals, Numpad6-0 for bigger/help heals.
I use this basic setup for 99% of fights (if healing on shaman I use same setup except Chain Heal instead
of Lifebloom obvously).
Now, when I reached M’uru, the sheer craziness of phase 2 with its constant window swaps, movement,
and high damage everywhere forced me to develop a new system, one which would constantly toss out
a Lifebloom rotation to the whole party with the goal of reliably rolling a full stack on all 5 targets. And it
would do this completely without me ever needing to individually choose targets, but rather just cycle
through on my normal dps spam. Now, Isboxer users have the wonderful option of doing this using their
system to create steps and playing around with the “Do not advance to the next step for at least X
seconds” settings so that while spamming your druid will switch to the next macro at the specified
interval. I wanted to try to emulate this function with HotkeyNet.
And the way do this (kind of) is through the use of <Toggle> and <DoHotkey> functions. <Toggle> will do
the next defined action in the list in a cycle, returning to the first definition after the last is done (also
known as “Round Robin”). <DoHotkey> does exactly what it says – it does Hotkey X, but the useful thing
here is you can insert this into whatever hotkey definition you want and it kind of hijacks the key press
and also activates the new <DoHotkey>, which can hold its own set of definitions separate from the
source press. So long story short, this means that you can set up something like the following in your
script:
<Hotkey CapsLockOn ScrollLockOn 1, 2, 3, 4>
<DoHotKey Hotkey Alt Ctrl H>
<SendLabel w1, w2, w3, w4, w5>
<Key %Trigger%>
<Hotkey Alt Ctrl H>
<Toggle>
<SendLabel w2>
<Key Numpad1>
<Toggle>
<SendLabel w2>
<Key Numpad2>
<Toggle>
<SendLabel w2>
<Key Numpad3>
<Toggle>
<SendLabel w2>
<Key Numpad4>
<Toggle>
<SendLabel w2>
<Key Numpad5>
<Hotkey CapsLockOn Alt 1>
<SendPC local>
<ResetToggles>
In my script I have all my “normal” hotkeys activated with CapsLockOn, so now if I want to activate
“turbo mode”, I just also switch on ScrollLock and it activates this new set of definitions. Now what this
script does is as follows: Each time I press 1, 2, 3, or 4 (or whatever keys you define here), it will also
jump down and activate the next Toggle in the Hotkey below, while also sending out the regular keys to
the 4 non-healer windows. These Toggles I have defined to cycle through Numpad1 through Numpad5
(keys on which I have bound my “/cast [target=Name] Lifebloom macros”). And then if I ever want to
make sure to reset the cycle back at Toggle 1, I can hit Alt-1.
Voila! Done! That was simple, right? Well… not yet. The problem is, of course, that you are going to be
spamming the keys rapidly, 5+ times per second. This will also cycle through the Toggles just as fast,
meaning that sure your first press will toss a Lifebloom on Toon 1, but then when your healer’s GCD is
ready, who knows where your Toggle will end up by then? This would more or less just toss your
Lifeblooms at random targets… not what we’re going for. So we need a way of delaying advancing to the
next Toggle. I tried experimenting with inserting <Wait> commands into the Toggle and it got very
messy very fast and I don’t recommend it. If somehow you get that to work, awesome – let me know!
(Ok, sure, the lazy cheater’s solution would be to simply use a gaming keyboard’s programmable macro
functions to have it auto-fire the button every 1.3 seconds. But imo that’s lame, and would likely get you
banned pretty quickly on some servers, and my own personal goal with multiboxing is to do it
legitimately – that is, in a way that was perfectly legal during retail TBC or whatever xpac.)
Instead, my answer for this is… MORE TOGGLES! By putting a lot more redundant Toggles into the list, it
will take that many more presses before it gets to a Toggle containing a new Lifebloom target. Assume
with me that my general spam speed is somewhere around 4 per second, and my Druid’s hasted GCD is
1.25 seconds (Note: yes this is overkill for achieving the 5 rolling LBs, where you only theoretically need a
sub 1.4s GCD, however I found in my personal testing getting to around 1.25-1.3 GCD gave me enough
wiggle room to land all 5 LB stacks quite reliably – this is at something like 330 or so Haste Rating.) So,
yes assuming a 1.25s GCD, and I’m spamming at 4 keypresses per second, then that means my goal
would be for every 5th keypress to trigger a Toggle containing the next Lifebloom target. So now here is
our new Toggle list definition:
<Hotkey Alt Ctrl H>
<Toggle>
<SendLabel w2>
<Key Numpad1>
<Toggle>
<SendLabel w2>
<Key Numpad1>
<Toggle>
<SendLabel w2>
<Key Numpad1>
<Toggle>
<SendLabel w2>
<Key Numpad1>
<Toggle>
<SendLabel w2>
<Key Numpad1>

<Key Numpad5>
So there you have it, every 5th press is your next Lifebloom target. HURRAY WE DID IT! Sounds great,
right? BUT WAIT, THERE’S MORE!
This system works great… with one major condition: it requires a consistent spam speed. Now obviously
during actual gameplay, your spam speed is going to vary a bit, faster/slower/whatever. The redundant
Toggles provide a little cushion of wiggle room – like, if you hit 6 presses between GCDs instead of 5,
that 6th Toggle will still be the next LB target. But it’s far from perfect. We can do better! And this is
where my system devolves into near-madness level complication.
Our goal: consistent spam speed. (That lazy cheater’s solution from above is sounding more and more
tempting…) For our solution, delve back into your dreaded elementary school music class and pull out
that nagging little tool called the metronome! Yes, friends, fire up an annoying click at the appropriate
speed to correspond with your GCD/spam speed, and all we gotta do is “spam to the beat” – and there
ya go, consistent spam speed! You can get a quick simple one by searching metronome on Google:
For our sample speeds mentioned above – a sub-1.25s GCD with 4 presses per second – a metronome at
120bpm while spamming eighth notes works perfectly. Actually, possibly a little too perfectly – my
actual in game GCD is 1.23s, so there is the tiniest bit of wiggle room for the 5th press to land at 1.25s,
but at least in my testing, it appears there is a little bit of leeway that the Game has and will usually let
your cast go through even if you press the button at 1.2 seconds instead of 1.25, I’m guessing to
compensate for differing latency times and such. But whatever the case, it works well for me! If you
want to test out using different GCD and spam speeds, bust out your math skills, set your metronome
appropriately, and go to town. It really works friends – in target dummy testing I was able to achieve a
constant 5-stacked LB for well over 5 minutes straight without dropping off once. Now obviously, in real-
raid situation, it’s much, much trickier.
So yes, if you watch my M’uru videos, what you don’t hear is the fact that I’m wearing headphones with
a constant beep beep beep beep going, and I’m spamming eighth notes on my keyboard the entire fight
(as best I can anyway). And it produces a glorious rolling Lifebloom stacks across the entire party
reliably, as long as I keep the beat going steady. Now, yes it does drop off occasionally when I mess up
my spam hitting other keys and such, especially during phase 2 with crazy window swaps and all. But
even in those times, the system will still keep throwing LBs around and will get your stacks rolling again.
For my first M’uru fight, I just had my 1-4 keys defined as above for the Toggle, as these are the main
keys I set up for various aspects of that fight. And then each time I hit a window swap key I would try to
spam 2 quick sixteenth-note keys afterwards to try to get the Toggle back on track. But then I realized I
could just also add the <DoHotkey> to my window swap keys, so now those presses will also advance
the Toggle.
So there you go. You’ve successfully turned WoW into a weird rhythm game like Dance Dance
Revolution for your fingers. It’s definitely awkward at first, but as with everything, the more you practice
it the smoother it gets, until at some point you realize Entropius is dead and you can finally stop
spamming.
Or… you can just pay for Isboxer and do all of this 1000% simpler.
