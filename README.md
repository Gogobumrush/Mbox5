# Mbox5
Some mbox setup and commands to find


## Overview

This guide is NOT comprehensive and is by no means the "correct" way to do things, but will offer some guidance and lessons learned that may help you as a multiboxer get started sooner.

This will be broken into different categories to try and make this into a more bite-sized guide. This is a collection of the information within the discord. 

The biggest recommendation I can give is to take your time with your setup. Practice on the dummy, fix all the random issues you have and get comfortable with your setup.

Go run a dungeon, write down all the issues you notice and repeat the process. This will save you a TON of time once you step into raids.



## Videos
For some great videos references check out some of the other multiboxers and how they position and play.

Mystro has videos on almost every boss with a RSham and also with Resto druid. Definitely helps you to see some awesome fights and get a good idea on ways to approach the bosses
